As we draw a close to the end of the sight manual, keep in mind there are some behind the scenes items that users can’t really see—unless they pop open dev tools or are using screen reader technology.

Make sure that your images have alt tags. Please for the love of god put alt tags on your images. Guess what? Screen readers READ the alt tags when used. It also provides a fallback when images aren’t loading and it helps with SEO. Do we have your scout’s honor?

### Scout Review

* Review the ARIA examples to make sure you are incorporating the most important into your markup. It’s not that hard, you just need to know what goes where.
