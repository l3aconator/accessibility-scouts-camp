# Alternatives to watching and hearing

---

If some one can’t see, they can still hear audio and video files on the web. What about those who can’t hear audio and visual content? WHOA. Didn’t think about that did ya? (You probably did, sorry the counselor in us is getting a little enthusiastic!)

As a thought exercise play the following audio file with your sound turned off—please don’t cheat:

[AUDIO FILE]

Kind of infuriating you can’t hear it, huh? (Guess what, it’s just empty noise anyways to keep you from cheating.)

Try this video with your sound turned off:

[VIDEO FILE]

Without the audio, it’s pretty hard to really know what is going on between the characters.

Hey scout! Don’t fret. These two problems have solutions. PROVIDE TRANSCRIPTS to your audio and video file. Think it’s a pain in the butt? Hire someone to do it. It will greatly improve the user experience for those who can’t hear. There’s also multiple ways for people to learn, some prefer video and audio, other’s prefer reading. You help those who can’t hear and those who have a different learning style. GREAT. That transcript can also be used be a screen reader too if that’s ever needed.

There’s plenty of things that can be done also to improve the transcript reading process. Some a bit more difficult than others, but step one is providing the transcript before enriching the experience.

Here are few ways to enrich the transcript experience, though:
