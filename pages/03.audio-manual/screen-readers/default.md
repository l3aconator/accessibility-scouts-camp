Wouldn’t it be terrible sitting in the woods at night without a lamp or fire to see anything? Imagine trying to use the Internet without visuals. It would be very hard to use.  Almost next to impossible. There’s a solution though and those are screen readers and tools to accept voice input to control the computer.

As you’ve seen so far through the sight manual a strong focus on content, image alt tags, and adding the extra aria attributes to our markup. Well guess what?! You’ve already learned about most of the tools to make a site accessible and screen readers happy. In turn that makes your users happy. Here we are going to go through some more complex code examples to show how advanced one can get with the aria spec in a web app and still have things make sense to the user and you.

Whew! That was a lot. You thought this was just the audio manual, huh? Accessibility is about catering to the largest audience. In practice one has to cater to both the visual and auditory audience at the same time. No easy task and takes a lot of work to pull off. Hopefully you can see how easy it can be to enrich the experience for those with visual impairments through the means of audio and dictation software.

Try some of them out. Go to a website you’ve never been to, a social media site, or even site you’ve developed. Close your eyes and see if you can navigate using the keyboard and maybe dictation. You’ll be surprised at how much harder it is easier to use if a good job was done or how easy it is if a good job was done.

### Scout Review

* Practice your ARIA tags
* Make sure you understand the code that is happening with the examples and why the experience is better from a visual and audio standpoint
* Test, test, and test with different screen readers to see if you can get around the site and that the tab order is working correctly. Make sure you content makes sense when read out loud
* Make sure your form inputs can handle dictation software and when errors occur that the user can understand what went wrong
